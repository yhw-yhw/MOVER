## What Can You Learn from MOVER?

* **3D Scene Initialization** with water-tight mesh (benefit from Total3DUnderstand and OccupancyNet).
* Single Video **Batch-wise SMPLify-X** for single person.
* **Ground-Plane & Camera Orientation Optimization** with human contacted feet.
* Three **HSIs Constraints**: the ordering depth, collision and contact.

<!-- Human-Scene Interactions (HSIs) can 
<br/> Ground-Plane & Camera Orientation Optimization.
<br/> 3D Scene Placement Optimization. -->

<br/>

## Installation

Please follow the [Installation Instruction](docs/Installation.md) to setup all the required packages.

<br/>

## Data
<!-- it stores in /is/cluster/work/hyi/dataset/MOVER_dataset -->

Please register [SMPL-X](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/) at first, and then download ```smpl-x_model.tar.gz``` from our [webpage](https://mover.is.tue.mpg.de), put it under ```${MOVER_REPORSITORY}/data/```.

We provide **demo** sequences and MOVER reconstructed humans and 3D scenes of PROX *qualitative* and *quantitative* in our [webpage](https://mover.is.tue.mpg.de).

See more details in [data document](docs/Dataset.md)

<br/>

## Get Started

We provide the core part of MOVER, use three different kinds of HSI constraints (depth, collision, and contact) to help understand the 3D scene. 
<!-- ### TODO

[] Scene Intialization

[] HPS Initialization -->

### Scene optimization with 2D cues and HSIs: 

```
cd ./demo
bash run.sh
```

We also provide the visualization for the final reconstructed 3D scenes and 3D humans.

### Visualize reconstructed 3D humans and 3D scene results:

```
cd ./demo
bash run_rendering.sh
```

### Scene Initialization

See more details in [scene initialization document](thirdparty/scene_initialization/readme.md)

### Human Pose ans Shape (HPS) Initialization

See more details in [HPS initialization document](thirdparty/HPS_initialization/readme.md)

<!-- and we will also release the scene initialization, HPS Initialization and camera & ground plane optimization soon. -->
